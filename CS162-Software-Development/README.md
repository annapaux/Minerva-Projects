### CS162 - Software Development

This course is organized around the principle that the only way to learn software development is to develop
software. Work together as a team to develop a significant web application. Examples include a social media
application or a distributed chat system. You will have the opportunity to apply and experience all aspects of
software development, including requirements analysis, design, planning, implementation, testing, and deployment.
