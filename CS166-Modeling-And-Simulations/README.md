# CS166-Modeling-And-Simulations

Have you ever wondered how people use computers to make decisions? In this course, you will learn how to apply
advanced modeling techniques such as cellular automata, network concepts from graph theory, probability theory,
and Monte Carlo simulation to analyze and predict the behavior of social, physical and economic systems. You will
learn from specific examples applied to portfolio management, traffic flow management, and analyzing social
networks.


We start the course by diving straight into your first simulation in the first week. You write structured code in Python
from the first until the last week of the course. After the first week, we cover three modeling frameworks â€” cellular
automata for modeling interactions on grids of cells, networks for more general interactions between nodes in a
graph, and Monte Carlo simulations showing how we can use simulation to generate random numbers and how we
can use random numbers to drive simulations of complex phenomena. We cover theoretical (mathematical) and
practical (implementation) aspects of each of the three frameworks.
