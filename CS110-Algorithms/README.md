# CS110 - Computation: Solving Problems with Algorithms

In this course students learn how to apply core concepts in the design and analysis of algorithms and data
structures. In so doing, they learn to use computational problem-solving techniques to address complex problems.
Hashing, searching, sorting, tree algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, random
number generation, and randomized algorithms are examples of algorithms students learn to exploit to solve
problems ranging from logistics and route optimization to DNA sequencing.
