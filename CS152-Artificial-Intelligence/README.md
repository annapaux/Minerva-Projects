# CS152 Artificial Intelligence

Apply methods and algorithms from Artificial Intelligence (AI) — such as propositional logic, logic programming,
predicate calculus, and computational reasoning — to a diverse range of applications from robot navigation to
restaurant selection with expert systems. Discover AI in action through an exploration of robotics, and gain an
appreciation of its convergence towards modern machine learning methods.
