# CS146-Computational-Statistics

How do weather scientists know for sure that a hurricane will hit the coast in two days? How would one devise
methods to forecast sales of a product? At the end of this course you should be equipped with tools with which to
gather and interpret data, but you should also be able to inform a scientific or business decision on the basis of
statistically rigorous arguments.

We start the course by connecting probability theory and statistics (see course pre-requisites) with Bayesian
inference, which is the mathematical framework for using observed data to update the information we have of a
system. Thereafter most of the course is focused on the data modeling process, covering various real-world
scenarios from sports, medicine, vehicle tracking, social sciences, and more. The last few weeks of the course are
spent on more advanced topics — probabilistic graphical models and Monte Carlo sampling — that allow us to work
with large models containing many variables and large data sets.
