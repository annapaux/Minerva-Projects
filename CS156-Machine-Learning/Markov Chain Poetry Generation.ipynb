    "# Analyzing word vs character based poems for different levels of order\n",
    "The order of a Markov chain is the length of words or characters considered before predicting the next character.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **character based poems**, results of low order are very short, as words not occurring in the dictionary get rejected. The words that do get accepted have little connection to each other and the poems don't make much sense, e.g. 'i do of goo day'. Poems of higher order show immediately more words that are being accepted, since the moel allows to 'look back' further and can generate the next letter based on multiple. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. 'I love you all the more'. If the current state is 'l' ('L'), the predicted character will be 'o', 'l' or 't' with equal probability. Having a state of order two and a current state of 'al' the model will know to predict 'l' next and generate the word 'all'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For **word based poem** the first results with low order already show plausible poems. However, poems with high order overfit to the training data if the size of training data is not large enough since a very specific string of multile words might only occur once in the entire text, resulting in the model quoting from the original rather than generating new texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideal order depends on the dataset and model. For example, if the corpus has very long words, the order for character based poems should be similar to the length of the words as well, in order to generate more words that are similar to the original text. However, if the corpus is not very large, setting the order very high would inhibit the word based generator to come up with novel creations, as there is not much variability in the options for the next words."
